Hi and thank you for supporting me. ;)

About normal maps..

If models look weird in your rendering application just flip the green channel of the Normal maps in photoshop.

You go to channels in Photoshop(next to layers)click on green channel and then "Invert" (under Image-Adjustments-Invert in PS)


A tip. You can sharpen your normal maps if you want crispier renders, just remember to normalize after sharpening ;)
